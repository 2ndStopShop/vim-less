# VIM-LESS

This vim bundle adds syntax highlighting.

This is/was a fork of a long dead copy and paste job that for some reason
merged a pull request that broke a variety of other things in vim. This does
what it is supposed to for the most part and most importantly doesn't break
anything. 


If you like it use it but it is not going to be maintained.
